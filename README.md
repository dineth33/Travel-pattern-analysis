This repository attempts to identify the travel patterns based on different activities performed by the passengers according to three main criteria. </br> 
        1. Temporal regularities  - Variation of the number of trips in each time of a day and day of the week </br>
        2. Trip length distributions  - Reletive frequency distribution of trips </br>
        3. Spatial dynamics - Frequency distribution from hexagon regions within a study area </br> 
 
<br/> 
Sample illustrations of travel patterns:

<b> Notes: </b> </br> 
passenger trips should be in gps records including the orign and destination clearly </br> 
please change the variable, feature and  file names according to your requirement  </br> 
feather file format has been used to efficient data transfers
