        1. Temporal regularities  - Variation of the number of trips in each time of a day and day of the week </br>
        2. Trip length distributions  - Reletive frequency distribution of trips </br>
        3. Spatial dynamics - Frequency distribution from hexagon regions within a study area </br>
